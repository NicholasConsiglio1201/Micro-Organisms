# Object Detection of Micro-Organisms with Yolov8 Model
This repository is for the steps and processes takent to develop the model we used for Object Detection and Tracking for Micro-Organisms.
**Note**: No Micro-Organism data is found in this repository since that data is important and classified.

**Description**: The goal of this project is to be able to track the movement of Copepods when they are threatened by other organisms. Our goal was to track and monitor how the Copepods behaved when there was a threat vs. when there was no threat.
To test our model we trained a model on Link from the "Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap" to analyze and see if our model after training can pick up his label and track where he moves.


***Below is an example of the Object Tracking being used with the Yolov8 Model.***
